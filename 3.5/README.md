# Mycodo 3.5-beta (experimental)

This is currently an experimental branch of mycodo. This will be a future stable release once a certain number of features have been added and when it's relatively bug-free. Unless I have been in direct contact with you regarding testing of this branch, I will not be providing technical support for any issues with this version. Instead, I recommend you check out the v3.0 stable branch.

### Goals

- [ ] CO2 Sensor support (working on)
- [ ] O2 Sensor support
- [ ] Email notification or audible alarm if at a specific sensor value or detect a critical failure (working on)
- [ ] Set electrical current draw of each device and prevent exceeding total current limit with different combinations of devices on
- [ ] Capture series of photos at different ISOs, combine to make HDR photo
- [ ] Timelapse video creation ability (define start, end, duration between, etc.)
